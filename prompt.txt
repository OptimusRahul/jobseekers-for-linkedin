Act as an expert in Gen AI

Product Overview:
There is an Chrome Extension which will be extracting the HR's email and phone(optional), job description. We need to build backend for it, we need to have a user which registers via phone number.
We need to store user resume, work_experience and other usefull information in a vector database. There will be an /gen-email which will take JOB DESCRIPTION and user number and now it will fetch the user info from the vector embeddings related to JD.
Now we need to make an LLM call which will be taking JD and User Info as input and generate an a customized mail for the user.

Tech Stack:
- Pyhton
- FastAPI
- Vector DB (Firebase)
- Postgres to store HR related info

We need to build a system prompt which needs to send to LLM and generate a customized email.
